# Hi, I'm Misbah

I'm a high school student who enjoys building with code.  
Right now, I'm working on a long-term project called **Tron** — something experimental, something that’ll take time.  

I’m interested in AI, machine learning, and systems that solve real problems.  
Outside of code, I take part in MUNs, teach through my tech society, and occasionally rescue stray animals.

Just learning, building, and figuring things out as I go.  
Still early in the journey — but excited for what’s next.
